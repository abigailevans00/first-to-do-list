## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- JavaScript


### What I learned

I learned how to make a to-do list using html5, css, and javascript. I began by structuring its basic contents. I used W3 Schools to learn how to close items out and add new items to the list. 


### Continued development

I would like to know how to do this off of the top of my head and cement my understanding of to-do lists.
